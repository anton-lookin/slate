## SDK Reference

NimbleCommerce iOS SDK classes are divided to three groups:
* manager classes - singleton classes that provides global access to shared actions and data. SDK contains settings, merchant and authorization managers. Authorization manager is used to perform authorization functions.
* helper classes - container and bean classes that used to perform API requests, present and store received from responses data.
* request classes - wrapper classes that used to perform specific NimbleCommerce API calls.
* beans classes - container objects to keep your data incapsulated

### NimbleCommerce iOS SDK Request Classes Description

Every request class is used to perform specific NimbleCommerce API call (get deal, save payment account, etc.). Every request class is wrapper around loader class which performs network communication and parses server response. Request classes use block-based and delegation pattern to notify about successful or failed call status. In case of successful response, received data is stored in object fields and can be accessed using object properties. Any detailed description about available actions and structure of NimbleCommerce iOS SDK classes can be found in your merchant portal in Mobile Apps section. Documentation is distributed in .docset format that allows you to import it in Xcode Documentation system.

### Recommendations

Loader classes usage remains similar if you use ARC or doesnâ€™t. Strong reference on loader object should be saved in field or property to keep loader live while loading routines are in progress. Loader can be created on initialization or can be instantiated lazily on first access to property. Examples for loaders initialization and usage for arc and manual memory management. Note that result blocks of loaders will be released and reset to nil as soon as loader completes, you should set result blocks before every loader execution.

Every loader extends NCLoader class that provides common interface for NimbleCommerce API calls. Every NCLoader has configuration fields described below, that will be set up automatically from managers or can be set up manually to configure loader with specific data.
