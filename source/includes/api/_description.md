## Description

NimbleCommerce API provides a set of programmatic interfaces that give you access to manipulate with platform data.
We work hard under our API and trying to implement modern approaches for it. NimbleCommerce API is mostly a RESTful API based on HTTP requests with JSON responses. 
Current version of NimbleCommerce API is *7*. 
Current version uses 1-step auth scheme to authorize and authenticate platform users, more information you can find under Authorization scheme of our documentation.
